**1. Executive Summary**

This report consolidates research findings on currently open AI/ML research funding opportunities accessible to senior undergraduate students in the United States as of August 2025. Opportunities identified include the Google Student Researcher Program, Microsoft Undergraduate Research Internships, the CRA-Microsoft Fellowship, and various avenues for exploring opportunities with smaller AI startups, contributing to open-source projects, and pursuing AI for social good. The report provides detailed information on application deadlines, eligibility requirements, and potential strategies for maximizing success.

**2. Key Players and Opportunities**

*   **Meta AI:** Actively recruiting Research Scientist Interns for 2025. Emphasis on research projects, with a focus on areas like generative AI, large language models, and responsible AI. Applications are highly competitive.
*   **OpenAI:** While direct undergraduate research positions are limited, opportunities may arise through contributing to open-source projects or contacting researchers directly.
*   **Google:** The Google Student Researcher Program offers a structured research experience under the mentorship of Google scientists. Applications are competitive and require a strong academic record and research experience. The Google AI Residency program is also an option for those seeking a more intensive research experience.
*   **Microsoft:** Microsoft Undergraduate Research Internships provide opportunities to work on cutting-edge research projects within Microsoft Research. The CRA-Microsoft Fellowship supports undergraduate research in computer science, with a focus on innovation and impact.
*   **Anthropic:** Similar to OpenAI, direct undergraduate positions are scarce. Focus on contributing to open-source projects and networking with researchers.
*   **Cohere:** Opportunities are primarily through direct outreach to researchers. Regularly monitor the Cohere blog ([https://blog.cohere.com/](https://blog.cohere.com/)) and publications ([https://www.cohere.com/research](https://www.cohere.com/research)) for names and contact information. Create a spreadsheet to track outreach efforts. Focus on specific research teams within Cohere (e.g., those working on retrieval-augmented generation, vector databases, or specific language models) and target outreach accordingly. Craft a template email referencing specific publications or projects of the researchers they contact to demonstrate genuine interest. Consider sending a LinkedIn connection request before an email to increase response rates.
