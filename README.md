## About

**Kestrel** is a local-first research assistant that self-schedules and executes support tasks over long horizons so you can stay focused on key, complex & novel tasks. It handles the mechanical work‚Äîsearching, filtering, extracting, and organizing evidence in the background, preparing it for review and analysis. 

**Designed for small local models.** Kestrel is built to run with **small LLMs (~1‚Äì7B)** via **Ollama**, so it‚Äôs **laptop/desktop-friendly** (macOS, Windows, Linux; CPU-only works, GPU optional). No server cluster required.

### What it does
- **Task Exploration:**: Leverages gathered evidence to iterate on tasks, identifying and pursuing new branches and next steps. 
- **Source Provenance**: Uses a deep research approach, but maintains a clear record of consulted searches and how they impact exploration and findings. 
- **Long-running support:** Keep tasks moving in the background and surface **auditable checkpoints** for review and redirection, rather than a single final report. 

> **Example:** Example: As you interpret a frontier paper and plan a novel study, Kestrel runs in the background to resolve the tooling (**Polars vs. pandas vs. Spark**), gathering real-world usage, extracting cited performance claims, and assembling a reviewable comparison.

### How it works (at a glance)
- **Research Agent** ‚Äî Executes concrete micro-tasks (search ‚Üí retrieve ‚Üí filter ‚Üí extract ‚Üí narrow summary) and proposes specific follow-ups when evidence warrants it.  
- **Orchestrator** ‚Äî Plans/schedules work, tracks progress and blockers, pivots when stalled, and emits checkpoints you can accept or adjust. This keeps efforts coherent over hours or days.

### Orchestrator profiles
| Profile        | Scope & behavior                                        | Typical runtime |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Hummingbird**| Quick breadth-first sweeps; targeted lookups.            | Minutes‚Äì~2h     |
| **Kestrel**    | Medium-horizon exploration with closely related branches.| Multi-hour      |
| **Albatross**  | Long-horizon, open-ended exploration with reviews.       | Day-scale+      |

(Names are mnemonic. Community-authored profiles with clear behaviors are welcome‚Äîe.g., a **Parrot** profile for multi-agent dialogue.)

### Data Contracts

Redis Queues and Channels:


REST API: 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) if not using the Dockerized version 
  - Recommended for Apple Silicon due to [Lack of GPU Passthrough](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/3849)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Installation

Clone the repository from Github:

```
git clone git@github.com:dankeg/KestrelAI.git
```

Ensure that Docker Desktop is running (easy way to check is running `docker info` in the terminal)

Navigate to the root of the repo, and run the following command to build and launch the application. 

```
docker compose up --build
```

Alternatively, rather than building locally images are built through Github Actions, and can be fetched with `docker pull` first.

After a few minutes, the application will finish building. By default, it launches at `http://localhost:5173/`. Navigate here in a browser, and it's ready to use!

## Usage

Using Kestrel is fairly straightforward. Create a new task, define a description for the research agents to base their exploration off of, and provide a time-box. Some examples are provided of tasks Kestrel can perform. 

From there, the dashboard lets you monitor progress, such as tracking searches & the resulting sources, viewing checkpoints & reports, and exporting results. 

## Roadmap
