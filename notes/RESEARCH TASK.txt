## FINAL REPORT: US Funding Organizations Supporting AI/ML Research (as of Oct 26, 2023) - Focused on Undergraduate Accessibility

This report summarizes the US funding landscape for AI/ML research, focusing on opportunities potentially accessible to senior undergraduate students. The list is prioritized based on the likelihood of undergraduate involvement and ease of access.

**What Has Been Discovered So Far:**

Significant funding for AI/ML research is available from both government and private sources. Government funding is substantial, driven by strategic national priorities. Private foundations are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI/ML and are directing resources towards responsible and beneficial AI development. Many funding opportunities are geared towards graduate students and research institutions, but opportunities exist for undergraduates, particularly through faculty-led projects, summer research programs, and smaller grants. Identifying these requires targeted searching and understanding the nuances of each organization's funding priorities.

**Key Sources & Evidence (Prioritized by Undergraduate Accessibility):**

**Tier 1: High Probability of Undergraduate Involvement**

*   **NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program:** (Source: [https://www.nsf.gov/](https://www.nsf.gov/)) – *Specifically designed for undergraduates.* REU sites are hosted at universities across the country and offer summer research experiences. Requires faculty nomination. *High Priority*.
*   **NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) – Leveraging for Undergraduate Faculty:** (Source: [https://www.nsf.gov/](https://www.nsf.gov/)) – While primarily for grad students, faculty often use GRFP awards to support undergraduate research within their labs. Understanding faculty GRFP status is key.
*   **DOE Computational Grand Challenge (CGC) – Undergraduate Participation:** (Source: [https://www.energy.gov/](https://www.energy.gov/)) – Some projects within the CGC explicitly mention undergraduate involvement or allow for it through faculty mentorship.
*   **University-Specific Research Programs:** Many universities have internal funding programs specifically for undergraduate research. *Crucial to investigate at the student’s institution.*

**Tier 2: Moderate Probability – Requires Faculty Connection/Project Alignment**

*   **NSF (National Science Foundation):** A major funder of AI/ML research. Undergraduate involvement is typically through faculty-led projects. (Source: [https://www.nsf.gov/](https://www.nsf.gov/))
*   **DOE (Department of Energy):** Funding AI/ML for scientific discovery. Undergraduate involvement is typically through faculty-led projects within DOE labs or collaborations. (Source: [https://www.energy.gov/](https://www.energy.gov/))
*   **The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation:** Supports AI research with a focus on societal benefit. *Look for smaller grants or collaborations with universities.* (Source: [https://www.mcgovernfoundation.org/](https://www.mcgovernfoundation.org/))
*   **Ford Foundation:** Increasingly interested in AI’s impact on equity and social justice. *Focus on university partnerships and smaller grants.* (Source: [https://fordfoundation.org/](https://fordfoundation.org/))
*   **MacArthur Foundation:** Supports research on AI's societal implications. *Similar approach to Ford Foundation.* (Source: [https://www.macfound.org/](https://www.macfound.org/))
*   **NSF SBIR/STTR Programs:** (Source: [https://www.sbir.gov/](https://www.sbir.gov/)) – *Small businesses often seek undergraduate interns to assist with research and development.* Requires proactive outreach to companies participating in these programs.

**Tier 3: Low Probability – Difficult for Direct Undergraduate Funding**

*   **CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency):** Focused on AI for cybersecurity applications. (Source: [https://www.cisa.gov/](https://www.cisa.gov/))
*   **OpenAI:** Industry-sponsored programs and research collaborations (Source: [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/))
*   **Google:** Research grants and collaborations in AI. (Source: [https://ai.google/research/](https://ai.google/research/))
*   **Microsoft:** Research grants and collaborations. (Source: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/))



**Current Research Focus (of Funding Organizations):** (Remains largely unchanged from previous checkpoint)

**Unexplored Areas/Questions:**

*   **State-Level Funding:** Investigation of state-level funding initiatives for AI/ML research.
*   **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Programs:** Exploration of CSR programs within large corporations that might offer research grants or internships.
*   **Smaller, Niche Foundations:** Researching smaller foundations focused on specific AI applications (e.g., AI for education, AI for healthcare).
*   **Networking with Faculty:** Identifying faculty members who have existing relationships with funding organizations and can facilitate undergraduate involvement.
