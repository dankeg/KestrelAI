## AI/ML Undergraduate Research Funding (US - 2024-2025) – FINAL REPORT

**1. Executive Summary**

A significant number of funding opportunities exist for undergraduate students interested in AI/ML research in the United States for the 2024-2025 academic year, primarily driven by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and its associated programs. The NSF’s Cooperative AI Research Institutes and specific grants like NSF 25-542 (Smart Health & Biomedical Research) and NSF 25-530 (CAIG) represent the most promising avenues for securing funding. Google AI Research Grant Program offers competitive support for innovative projects pushing the boundaries of AI, while AI4ALL provides focused support for K-12 and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The Data & Society Initiative’s research grants target projects exploring the social and ethical implications of AI, demanding a strong emphasis on ethical considerations. Microsoft AI Research – Undergraduate Research Program presents limited opportunities, typically tied to specific research areas and requiring a practical, engineering-focused approach. Amazon Research with Reality offers potential for projects involving robotics and computer vision, demanding an engineering-oriented methodology. Micro-grants, though less prevalent, represent a viable option for smaller-scale initiatives. Industry partnerships, often facilitated through internships, provide potential access to real-world datasets and collaborative research experiences. Open-source AI resources, including datasets and tools, are increasingly accessible and crucial for independent research. The overall landscape indicates a robust ecosystem of funding opportunities, though competition remains high, necessitating well-defined research proposals and a strong commitment to the chosen field.
