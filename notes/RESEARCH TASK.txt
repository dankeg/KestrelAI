## AI/ML Funding for Senior Undergraduates (US) – Consolidated Report – November 3, 2024

**Objective:** Identify and synthesize currently open funding opportunities (grants, fellowships, programs) supporting AI/ML research available to senior undergraduate students in the United States. This report builds upon previous research checkpoints and prioritizes actionable, current opportunities.

**Summary:** Direct funding for undergraduate AI/ML research remains limited. The most viable pathways continue to be securing a research assistant (RA) position within a faculty member’s funded project or participating in structured research experiences like NSF REU sites. This report details current opportunities, eligibility requirements, and application processes.

**I. Government Programs & Research Experiences**

*   **NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites:** https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/ai funds numerous REU sites focused on AI/ML. Search the NSF REU database ([URL_11]) using keywords like "AI," "Machine Learning," and "Data Science." **Eligibility:** US citizenship or permanent residency generally required; rising seniors strongly preferred. **Application:** Varies by site; typically involves an online application, transcripts, and letters of recommendation. **Deadlines:** Vary significantly – check individual program websites. Continuously monitor for new postings.
*   **NSF AI Focused Programs:** While direct undergraduate grants are rare, explore core programs at https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/ai and solicit information from professors regarding potential RA positions within funded projects.

**II. University-Based Opportunities**

*   **University of Chicago DSI AI + Science Research Funding:** https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/research-funding/ai-science-research-funding-opportunities/ lists funding opportunities. Primarily for faculty/postdocs, but may offer RA positions for undergraduate students. **Eligibility:** Determined by the PI of the funded project. **Application:** Contact faculty at the University of Chicago directly regarding RA positions.
*   **University of Florida Funding Opportunities:** https://ai lists external/internal AI/ML funding. **Eligibility:** Varies; see https://ai for details.
*   **University of Virginia AI Funding:** https://researchdev compiles AI funding opportunities. **Eligibility:** Varies; see https://researchdev for details.
*   **University of Rhode Island AI Funding:** https://its lists AI funding opportunities. **Eligibility:** Varies; see https://its for details.

**III. Scholarship & Grant Databases (Limited Scope)**

*   **Scholarshipsandgrants.us:** https://libguides compilation of 20+ AI/ML opportunities (primarily scholarships). **Eligibility:** Varies; see https://libguides for details.
*   **Abroadin:** https://scholarshipsandgrants list of AI/ML scholarships. **Eligibility:** Varies; see https://scholarshipsandgrants for details.
*   **OnlineDegrees.sandiego.edu:** https://abroadin AI/ML scholarship listings. **Eligibility:** Varies; see https://abroadin for details.

**IV. Emerging & Ongoing Opportunities**

*   **Google DeepMind Education Programs:** https://deepmind Explore potential opportunities. While direct undergraduate funding isn’t explicitly listed, investigate available programs and contact them via the website for inquiries.
*   **Path to Science - AI Directory:** https://www.pathwaystoscience.org/Discipline.aspx?sort=TEC-AI_Artificial+Intelligence lists organizations involved in AI research. While not a direct funding source, it provides contacts for potential research opportunities or internal funding programs.
*   **Portable Funding Programs:** [URL_17] provides a list of portable funding programs that could support undergraduate research, though not specifically AI/ML focused.

**V. Actionable Next Steps & Prioritized Strategies**

1.  **Proactive Faculty Outreach:** The highest priority. Identify PIs at leading universities (Stanford, MIT, CMU, UC Berkeley, etc.) with funded AI/ML projects. Craft a standardized email expressing interest in contributing.
2.  **NSF REU Database Monitoring:** Continuously monitor https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/ai for new REU postings.
3.  **University-Specific RA Position Inquiries:** Contact faculty at universities listed above (https://ai, https://researchdev, https://its, [URL_14]) regarding potential RA positions.
4.  **Google Research Catalog Population:** Systematically populate a tracking document with data extracted from identified opportunities.
5.  **Explore Corporate Research:** Investigate Amazon Research publications and collaborations for less-publicized opportunities.

**VI. Resources & Links (Consolidated)**
